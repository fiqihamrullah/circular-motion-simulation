# Circular Motion Simulation

This Application simulates the circular motion according to parameter inputs by implementing the law of physics. 
This is my old project, I am a fan of demonstrating math science into visual presentation. 
I only recently started using Git as my portfolio.

Feel Free to use for learning purpose.
